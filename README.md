The code is likely to change dramatically as the series continues, therefore, each part will be branched to match the parts/episodes of the series.

# Getting the code.
The code now has a dependency on my cwRuntime library, which is included as a submodule in /dependencies/cwRuntime.
If you are using the GitHub desktop client, it automatically clones the submodule when cloning this repository.
Other clients may need you to manually clone the submodule (see respective client documentation).
